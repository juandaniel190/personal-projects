**Q4 Sales Performance Analysis · 81 AEs · 4 Territories**
Prepared by Juan Daniel Amézquita | Revenue Operations Manager

## Slide 1 — Territory Snapshot

**Insight:** EMEA leads all territories; APAC pipeline at 56% signals systemic underperformance.

| KPI | Value | Context |
|-----|-------|---------|
| Overall SQL Attainment | 57.7% | 1,178 of 2,040 SQLs |
| Overall Pipeline Attainment | 78.7% | $630M of $800M target |
| SQL-Pipeline Gap | 21pp | Persistent across all regions |

| Territory | AEs | SQL % | Pipeline % | Gap (pp) | Avg Deal | % Fully Ramped |
|-----------|-----|-------|-----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| EMEA | 13 | 78% | 89% | 11 | $437K | 69% |
| North America | 35 | 57% | 79% | 22 | $570K | 46% |
| LATAM | 17 | 58% | 78% | 20 | $558K | 71% |
| APAC | 16 | 43% | 56% | 13 | $498K | 50% |

**Talk track:** EMEA is the benchmark — smallest team, best balance. APAC underperforms on both dimensions even among fully ramped reps. NA's numbers are dragged down by a recent hiring wave (10 of 35 still ramping).

## Slide 2 — SQL-Pipeline Gap

**Insight:** Pipeline outpaces SQL by 11-33pp — fewer leads, but larger deals compensate. SQL targets may be structurally miscalibrated.

**Three supporting points:**

1. **SQL targets may not reflect market reality** — Only 3 of 46 fully ramped AEs exceed 100% SQL attainment.
2. **Deal quality varies by region** — LATAM/NA avg deals $558K-$570K vs. $437K EMEA. Fewer but larger.
3. **Qualification behavior** — Reps self-select higher-value deals over volume. This explains the gap but masks pipeline concentration risk.

**Talk track:** The 21pp gap is not random — it's structural. Before attributing SQL underperformance to execution, audit whether the targets themselves are right. A bottoms-up capacity model would clarify this.

## Slide 3 — Ramp Status

**Insight:** 21% of the team is still ramping. Fully ramped AEs deliver 2.2x better pipeline results.

| Ramp Stage | AEs | % of Team | Pipeline Attainment |
|------------|-----|-----------|-------------------|
| Ramping (0-3mo) | 17 | 21% | 41.2% |
| Early (4-6mo) | 18 | 22% | 69.5% |
| Fully Ramped (7mo+) | 46 | 57% | 89.9% |

| Region | Ramping | Early | Fully Ramped | Total |
|--------|---------|-------|-------------|-------|
| EMEA | 2 | 3 | 8 | 13 |
| North America | 10 | 8 | 17 | 35 |
| LATAM | 3 | 2 | 12 | 17 |
| APAC | 2 | 5 | 9 | 16 |

**Key metrics:**

- **NA ramp burden:** 10 of 35 AEs ramping (only 46% fully ramped vs. 71% LATAM, 69% EMEA)
- **Pipeline multiplier:** 2.2x (89.9% fully ramped vs. 41.2% ramping)
- **Tenure correlation:** r = 0.37 — moderate. Coaching quality and territory design likely matter more than tenure alone.

**Talk track:** Ramping AEs are the single biggest drag on aggregate numbers. NA in particular bet heavily on new hires — if ramp programs don't accelerate these reps, the numbers won't improve for 2+ quarters.

## Slide 4 — Individual Performance

**Insight:** 39% of fully ramped AEs hit pipeline target, but 15% are below 50% — a tail that needs intervention.

**Pipeline attainment distribution (46 fully ramped AEs):**

| Bucket | Count | Note |
|--------|-------|------|
| 0-25% | 3 | Immediate intervention |
| 25-50% | 4 | At risk |
| 50-75% | 7 | Below target |
| 75-100% | 14 | Near target |
| 100%+ | 18 | On/above target |

**Top performers:**

| Rank | ID | Territory | Pipeline % | SQL % | Tenure | Avg Deal |
|------|----|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | 123496 | LATAM | 196% | 93% | 14mo | $698K |
| 2 | 123512 | NA | 149% | 63% | 13mo | $979K |
| 3 | 123498 | LATAM | 141% | 63% | 10mo | $743K |

**At risk (fully ramped, below 50% pipeline):**

| ID | Territory | Pipeline % | Tenure |
|----|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 123474 | APAC | 5% | 7mo |
| 123465 | EMEA | 19% | 7mo |
| 123497 | LATAM | 25% | 8mo |
| 123482 | APAC | 43% | 11mo |

**Talk track:** The scatter plot shows two patterns — "high SQL / lower pipeline" and "low SQL / high pipeline" (large-deal strategy). The bottom tail of 7 reps warrants structured coaching conversations now, not next quarter.

## Slide 5 — Five Hypotheses

**Insight:** Each hypothesis requires specific data to confirm or rule out. This is an investigation framework, not a conclusion.

| # | Hypothesis | Evidence | Validate With |
|---|-----------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | SQL targets are miscalibrated | 57.7% SQL vs. 78.7% pipeline | Historical SQL trends, market sizing, ICP penetration |
| 2 | APAC has structural issues beyond ramp | Fully ramped at 71.3%; two reps near-zero at 6+ months | Win/loss analysis, competitive landscape, product-market fit |
| 3 | Recent hiring wave dilutes metrics | 17 of 81 AEs (21%) ramping; NA has 10 of 17 | Hiring dates, ramp timelines, onboarding effectiveness |
| 4 | Top performers master large-deal strategy | LATAM/NA avg $558K-$570K vs. $437K EMEA | Deal-level data, vertical breakdown, expansion vs. new logo |
| 5 | Bottom performers need formal intervention | 7 fully ramped AEs below 50% pipeline | Manager mapping, coaching logs, PIP history, activity metrics |

**Talk track:** Present these as open questions, not accusations. The goal is to get buy-in from sales leadership to share the data needed for validation. Frame it as "we have strong signals — let's confirm before acting."

**Additional data to validate hypotheses (and how to use it):**

- **H1 (SQL miscalibration):** Historical SQL attainment by territory (4–6 quarters), pipeline/SQL ratio over time, market sizing / ICP penetration. Compare long-term attainment to targets; if SQL has sat ~57–60% while pipeline ~78%, support for recalibration. Use market sizing for bottoms-up "max SQLs" vs. targets.
- **H2 (APAC structural):** Win/loss by region and APAC rep, competitive reasons, deal-level data (size, stage, cycle), product usage by region. Compare APAC win rates and velocity to other regions (controlling for tenure); win/loss reasons clarify market vs. execution vs. product-fit.
- **H3 (Hiring wave):** Hire date per AE, planned ramp timeline, onboarding completion, manager assignment and span. Segment attainment by cohort; if new hires track historical ramp, dilution is expected; if behind, use onboarding/manager data to diagnose.
- **H4 (Large-deal strategy):** Deal-level data (size, vertical, new logo vs. expansion), pipeline/closed-won by segment, activity by rep. Compare deal mix and win rates of top vs. middle vs. bottom performers; validate strategy and inform playbooks/target design.
- **H5 (Bottom 7 intervention):** Manager mapping for the 7 reps, coaching/1:1 logs, PIP history, activity (calls, meetings, opportunities). Check clustering by manager/territory; compare activity and coaching to reps who improved — low activity → coaching first; high activity, low conversion → territory or PIP.

**Initial recommendations based on this data:**

- **Recalibrate SQL targets (0–30 days):** Use 57.7% SQL vs. 78.7% pipeline plus historical and market data to audit; set achievable targets so the gap reflects execution, not bad math.
- **APAC deep-dive (0–30 days):** Win/loss and PMF review; individual plans (coaching, territory, or performance path) for bottom APAC reps.
- **Structured intervention for bottom 7 (0–30 days):** Map to managers; review coaching and activity; put each on time-bound coaching plan or PIP (use data to decide who gets coaching vs. PIP vs. territory change).
- **Accelerate ramp (30–60 days):** Invest in ramp programs (buddy, playbooks, milestones); use hire dates and onboarding data to track ramp curves and fix bottlenecks.
- **Deal-quality metric (30–60 days):** Composite (e.g. pipeline/SQL, win rate, deal size) to compare "fewer, bigger" vs "more, smaller" by territory and inform target/comp design.

## Slide 6 — Action Plan

**Insight:** Recalibrate targets, fix APAC, manage performance, accelerate ramp — in that order.

| Phase | Timeline | Priority | Action | Expected Impact |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|----------------|
| NOW | 0-30 days | HIGH | Audit SQL targets | Remove structural miscalibration; set achievable baselines |
| NOW | 0-30 days | HIGH | Deep-dive APAC | PMF review, competitive analysis, individual plans for reps <50% |
| NOW | 0-30 days | HIGH | Performance-manage bottom 7 | Coach, adjust territory, or PIP for fully ramped AEs <50% |
| NEXT | 30-60 days | MED | Accelerate ramp programs | Buddy programs, playbooks, milestone targets for 17 ramping AEs |
| NEXT | 30-60 days | MED | Build deal quality metric | Composite score (pipeline/SQL, win rate, deal size) for cross-territory comparison |
| LATER | 60-90 days | LOW | Territory redesign | Equalize quotas; current range $10M-$12.5M with 30% deal size variance |
| LATER | 60-90 days | LOW | Monitor NA hiring cohort | Validate manager bandwidth, lead flow, enablement for 10 ramping reps |

**Expected outcome:** Recalibrated targets within 30 days, APAC stabilized by Q1, bottom cohort resolved, ramp time reduced ~20%.

**Talk track:** Lead with the SQL audit — it's the highest-signal, lowest-controversy action. APAC deep-dive and performance management are harder conversations but can run in parallel. The 30-60 day items depend on the first phase being underway.
